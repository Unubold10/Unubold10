üéì I'm a final year **Computer Science and Electronics** student at the **University of Bristol**.  
üí° My main interests are in **Machine Learning**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Intelligent Systems** to find ways to make technology smarter *and* safer.  
üåç Originally from **Mongolia**, now based in **Bristol, UK**, I enjoy building projects that connect algorithms, security, and real world systems.  
üß† Always learning, always experimenting ‚Äî from low-level C work to cloud-based ML solutions.
