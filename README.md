# 👋 Hi, I'm Unubold Tuguldur

🎓 I'm a final year **Computer Science and Electronics** student at the **University of Bristol**.  
  My main interests are in **Machine Learning**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Intelligent Systems** to find ways to make technology smarter *and* safer.  
  Originally from **Mongolia**🇲🇳, now based in **Bristol, United Kingdom**🇬🇧, I enjoy building projects that connect algorithms, security, and real world systems.  
  Always learning, always experimenting — from low-level C work to cloud-based ML solutions.
